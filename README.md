### Firebase Authentication System
I  use the Firebase Authentication system for this ecommerce website. There are two types of authentication. One is Using gmail account and another is using email and password .You can register this system using two ways. 

### React Router 6 is an interesting update. Especially Nesting routing and redirects. Redicet feature is easier than version 5. I used a new version of React router here .

### Using redux in this project was challenging for me. This state management system.FIrst  I used redux to set All data from my server site.Then add cart data.Update cart, Remove from cart.Clear all the cart and set Product Quantity. This was very challenging for me and interesting also.

### Stripe Payment Gateway is also Challenging for me.i used here Stripe Payment gateway to get  payment from  customers.
